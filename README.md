# Stilux
My own programming language built in go (in development)

You must separe the instruction with -|

**KEYWORDS**

*out*:

    out [text]
    
    to write variables you only have to write ${variableType-variableName} in the text
*var*:

    var [name] [type] (content)
    
    The types are
      - String
      - Int
      - Float32 (or float)
      - Float64
      - Bool
*if*:

    if condition:
        out True
        out Hi
    -
        out False
        out not a good day, the condition is false
*in*:

    in [variableName]






Due to the fact that the project is still in development this are few of the features I want to add to Stilux, if there is anyone who would like to be part of the project and join me, write to me on discord: @stilo01 thanks
